# ☕ Coffee Orders Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of coffee order data from 2019 to 2022. The goal was to uncover trends and insights related to customer preferences, sales seasonality, and product performance across different coffee types. The analysis leverages data visualization and statistical techniques to deliver actionable insights for optimizing business decisions.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data accuracy by handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and structuring the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated trends across multiple dimensions, including year-over-year sales, monthly seasonality, and product-specific performance.
- **Visualizations**: Created visual representations of the data to easily communicate findings, including annual and monthly sales trends for each coffee type.


## 📈 Insights & Outcomes
- **Annual Sales Trends**:
  - "Lib" emerged as the top-selling coffee type, with a particularly strong performance in 2022.
